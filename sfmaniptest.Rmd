```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##Library

```{r}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
```

##Load Spatial Data

```{r}
private_parcel <- st_read(dsn = ".",
                          layer = "Private_Parcels")

addresses <- private_parcel %>% 
  select(Planning, Master__35, Master__36, Improvem_1, Land.Value, Area_, Acres, Stand_Id, geometry)

colnames(addresses) <- c("ParcelID", "Addr1", "Addr2", "Improvement", "LandValue", "Area", "Acres", "PublicStand", "geometry")

addresses1 <- na.omit(addresses)

addresses <- addresses %>% 
  mutate(Val = Improvement + LandValue)

```
Notes:  Could not pull in spatial data from a different drive (G drive for SS), would cause R to crash everytime.
